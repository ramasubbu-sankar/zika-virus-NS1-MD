# Zika-virus-NS1-MD
MD simulations of NS1 proteins of Zika and Dengue viruses 


The directories are named same as the systems simulated in the manuscript. Each directory contains the initial minimized co-ordinates along (em.gro) and index (index.ndx) files. The topology and molecular dynamics parameter (.mdp) files are copied in separate directories, mdp and toppar respectively.

The directories ZIKV_APO, ZIKV_POPE, ZIKV_CHOL20 and ZIKV_CHOL40 respectively contain files corresponding to ZIKAAPO, ZIKVPOPE, ZIKVCHOL20 and ZIKVCHOL40 systems.

The directories DENV_APO, DENV_POPE, DENV_CHOL20 and DENV_CHOL40 respectively contain files corresponding to DENVAPO, DENVPOPE, DENVCHOL20 and DENVCHOL40 systems.
